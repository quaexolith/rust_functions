# rust_functions
Functions in Rust

Use snake_case all lowercase

# Parameters
Variables part of the function's signature.

Type must be declared in the function's signature.

# Statements and Expressions
Functions bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression.

Rust is an expression-based language.

Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.

Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.

* Calling a function is an expression.
* Calling a macro is an expression.
* A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression.

Expressions do not include ending semicolons.
